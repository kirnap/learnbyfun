# Reqular expressions guideline
---
I always have some trouble to write down a regular expression for a given matching task. The thing though, nobody properly introduced what is the working principle behind regular expressions. Finally I found very very useful youtube video, I'd highly recommend to watch it for those who wants to be more competent on regular expressions.
