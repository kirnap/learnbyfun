** That file is to introduce text manipulation via common bash commands, e.g. sed, awk, tr.

Example 1:
Let us say you have a foo.txt file containing a sentence:
 "instruction": "Pick up the green cucumber and put it to the left of the orange speaker",
However, you want to change it to that:
  Pick up the green cucumber and put it to the left of the orange speaker
To do that you need following lines  
1) sed has nice s command for substition, here is an example of it
   Desired command to achieve that cat foo.txt | sed s/'"instruction":'// 
2) tr is useful for inplace replacement of undesired chars:
   cat foo.txt | sed s/'"instruction":'// | tr '"' ' ' | tr ',' ' '
3) Finally you need to remove the TAB spaces
   cat foo.txt | sed s/'"instruction":'// | tr '"' ' ' | tr ',' ' ' | sed 's/^[ \t]*//'

Example 2:
Suppose you want to check the specific line of a .txt like file:
1) You may find sed useful: (e.g. line 4-9)
   sed -n '4,9p;10q' your-file-name
